MoveDID Twitter Community Booster

----------

Description

The MoveDID Twitter Community Booster is an AI-powered Twitter agent designed to energize the Movement Network community. Built on the ElizaOS framework with a customized knowledge base (RAG), it engages users by generating mock MoveDID previews—decentralized identity snapshots featuring a type (e.g., Human, AI Agent) and a fun description—then tweets personalized hype messages to boost participation. Initially off-chain for simplicity, it’s poised for future on-chain integration to create real MoveDIDs, enhancing trust and identity within the Movement ecosystem.

Core Idea

-   Off-Chain (Current): The agent responds to tweets (e.g., “
    
    [@MoveDIDBooster](https://x.com/MoveDIDBooster) give me a MoveDID”) with mock MoveDID previews and community hype, using predefined types (Human, Organization, AI Agent, Smart Contract) inspired by MoveDID’s framework. No blockchain required—just pure Twitter engagement powered by ElizaOS and RAG.
    
-   On-Chain (Future Enhancement): Integrates with the Movement Network to mint real MoveDIDs via the Aptos SDK, linking Twitter handles to on-chain identities. Users get a verifiable DID (e.g., did:move:0xabc123) tweeted back, tying social activity to the blockchain.

Example Workflows

Off-Chain Workflow (Step 1)

1.  User Input: Tweets “[@MoveDIDBooster](https://x.com/MoveDIDBooster) give me a MoveDID.”
    
2.  Agent Response: Analyzes the request (or uses preloaded data) and tweets: 

    “[@UserX](https://x.com/UserX) , your MoveDID preview: Type: Human, Description: #mAInia trailblazer—Movement’s lucky to have you!”
    
3.  Outcome: User feels recognized, community buzz grows—all off-chain.
    

On-Chain Workflow (Future)

1.  User Input: Tweets “[@MoveDIDBooster](https://x.com/MoveDIDBooster) give me a MoveDID” and provides a wallet address (e.g., via DM or reply).
    
2.  Agent Response: Creates a real MoveDID on the Movement testnet, then tweets: “
    
    [@UserX](https://x.com/UserX), your MoveDID is live: did:move:0xabc123! Check it out: [testnet link]. Welcome to Movement!”
    
3.  Outcome: User gets a blockchain-verified identity, boosting trust and engagement.
